My name is Sam Spackman and I am an absolute data science junkie.

<img src="/assets/images/About_pics/Sam Headshot.jpg" alt="" style="width:800px;"/>

I am a *total* data nerd. I love discussing how to enhance data science workflows, uncover insights, and dive into the field in general.

### That's why I started this blog

-- To challenge the misconception that effective data scientists are only born with exceptional math or programming skills. I'm proof that with passion and dedication, anyone can thrive in this field.

### Bringing Data Science to Life

With a Master's in Statistics from Brigham Young University and years of experience at Swire Coca-Cola and Qualtrics, I've curated extensive datasets, developed predictive models, and streamlined operations using technologies like PySpark, AWS Sagemaker, and Hugging Face Transformers. My projects include leveraging Bayesian statistics for geocaching strategies, using LLMs to extract insights from medical records and tweets, and more.
